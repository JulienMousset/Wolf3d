This project is  It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way.

# Wolf3d

Wolf3d is a project inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game, which was the first FPS ever. The project's goal is to discover the mathematical notion of complex numbers and to take a peek at the concept of optimization in computer graphics (multi-threading) by modelizing some fractals.

## How to use

- Compile : `make`
- Remove object files : `make clean`
- Remove object files and program : `make fclean`
- Start fresh and re-compile : `make re`

## Executing

Execute the program with the fractal name of your choice like this : `./fractol mandelbrot`

The fractals available are : `julia`, `mandelbrot`, `burning_ship`, `tricorn`, `celtic_mandelbar`, `celtic_mandelbrot`, `buffalo`, `celtic_heart`.

Press `TAB` to print the menu inside the program.
